About R script
Script called run_analysis.R that does the following.
	I.	Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
	⁃	Reading files
	⁃	Reading trainings tables
	⁃	Reading testing tables
	⁃	Reading feature vector
	⁃	Reading activity labels
	⁃	Assigning column names
	⁃	Merging all data in one set
	II.	Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
	⁃	Reading column names
	⁃	Create vector for defining ID, mean and standard deviation
	⁃	Making necessary subset from setAllInOne
	III.	Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
	IV.	Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
	V.	From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
	⁃	Making second tidy data set
	⁃	Writing second tidy data set in txt file

About Variables:
	I.	a_train, b_train, a_test,  b_test, c_train and c_test contain the data from the downloaded files.
	II.	a_data, b_data and c_data merge the previous datasets to further analysis.
	III.	features contains the correct names for the a_data dataset, which are applied to the column names stored in
